    The web-installer image ships a full lib/ on the data partition, and OTA
    updates only replace the firmware partition — so after the first update
    that changes a framework API, the stale lib/mpos shadows the new frozen
    modules and the OS crashes at boot (e.g. the 0.16.1+ launcher reading
    app.categories against a 0.16.0 App class: 'App' object has no attribute
    'categories'). Compare release strings and skip lib/ on mismatch so the
    device boots the self-consistent frozen tree instead.

    The frozen release is obtained by importing mpos.build_info BEFORE lib/
    is on sys.path; the import is then purged from sys.modules so a valid
    lib/ override can still shadow mpos normally afterwards. The lib/ side
    is read as plain text (no import) to keep stale code off the path.
