# ponytail: wraps SPI.Device so the upstream lora driver (which expects
# standard machine.SPI: write_readinto/write/readinto) can talk through
# lvgl_micropython's split SPI.Bus/SPI.Device API.
#
# SPIAdapter uses a reentrant Python-level lock (count + owner tid).
# Each individual byte transfer via the C-level transfer() function
# handles bus arbitration atomically (spi_device_acquire_bus/release
# per transaction).  We never call C-level device.lock()/unlock()
# because holding the bus across FreeRTOS task boundaries with the
# MicroPython GIL held deadlocks against the display driver's SPI flush
# (which runs in a separate FreeRTOS task without the GIL).
#
# wrap_sx126x_cmd() monkey-patches lora.SX1262._cmd() to hold the
# Python-level lock across the CS-low span — including optional
# write_buf/read_buf (FIFO read/write) which follow the main
# write_readinto in the upstream driver while CS is still held low.
# _wait_not_busy() runs BEFORE lock acquisition so the display can
# flush while the LoRa chip is processing the previous command.
